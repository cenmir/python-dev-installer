# runMarimoFile.ps1

# This script is designed to be called from a Windows right-click context menu
# to open a Python file with Marimo in the same PowerShell window.

# --- Configuration ---
# Define the path to your default virtual environment.
# IMPORTANT: Make sure this path is correct for your system.
# Example: $env:USERPROFILE\venvs\default
$venvPath = Join-Path -Path $env:USERPROFILE -ChildPath ".venvs\default"

# --- Script Logic ---

# Get the full path of the clicked Python file from the arguments.
# $args[0] contains the path passed by the right-click context menu.
$filePath = $args[0]

# Get the directory and file name from the full path.
$fileDir = Split-Path -Path $filePath -Parent
$fileName = Split-Path -Path $filePath -Leaf

# Define the path to the virtual environment activation script.
$activateScriptPath = Join-Path -Path $venvPath -ChildPath "Scripts\Activate.ps1"

# Check if the virtual environment activation script exists.
# If not, display an error and keep the window open for the user to read.

    Read-Host "Press Enter to exit..."
    exit 1 # Exit with an error code if the venv isn't found

# Use a try-catch block to handle potential errors during activation or Marimo launch.
# This ensures the window stays open to display any error messages.
