### Easy .venv setup for new projects for vs-code users

There is a useful file in Scripts called `init.bat` which you can copy to a new project folder and double-clicking it will create a virtual environment (.venv) for that project and install the above mentioned packages. Useful if you want to keep dependencies separate between projects. VS-Code will automatically detect the .venv folder and use it as the Python interpreter for that project.
